This project benchmarks a simple Flight Schedule Monitor application—scraping airline homepages for basic metadata—using both serial and parallel programming in Python. We target ten major carriers: Singapore Airlines, Air France, Air Vistara, Garuda Indonesia, Malaysia airlines, Ryanair, Vietnam airlines, AirAsia, Thai airways and Cathay Pacific.
